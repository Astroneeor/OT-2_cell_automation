Ok these are the protocols that i kinda need ot make into fully fledged functions that biologists can use

dispensing liquid (easy enough)

Aspiration of media then replacing the media (Media Replacement)

Aspirating media, washing media (multiple times) with PBS fluid
- Low residual volume needed to not worry about dilution
- Potentially mixing

Separating part of the cells to use for counting


OK I have to make an improved sitribute that takes in 1000 microL
and then just distributes it from a list, cuz rn it's a 1 on 1 transfer and it's slow asf
Like it works yes but if I can make it like 3x faster why wouldn't I, so new function time I guess
Takes 1000 microL and distrubutes from 10 - 100 serially without going back to revervoir
