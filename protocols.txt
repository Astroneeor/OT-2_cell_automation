Ok these are the protocols that i kinda need ot make into fully fledged functions that biologists can use

dispensing liquid (easy enough)

Aspiration of media then replacing the media (Media Replacement)

Aspirating media, washing media (multiple times) with PBS fluid
- Low residual volume needed to not worry about dilution
- Potentially mixing

Separating part of the cells to use for counting
