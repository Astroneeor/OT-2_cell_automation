Ok these are the protocols that i kinda need ot make into fully fledged functions that biologists can use

dispensing liquid (easy enough)

Aspiration of media then replacing the media (Media Replacement)

Aspirating media, washing media (multiple times) with PBS fluid
- Low residual volume needed to not worry about dilution
- Potentially mixing

Separating part of the cells to use for counting

full passaging of cells 

Testing out touch tip function to get rid of bubbles at the tip
- Touch tip on one side or all sides?
- Can I just submerge the pipette into the well and do it that way? (contamination though)
